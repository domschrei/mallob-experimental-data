# logs/

Each directory corresponds to one certain run of Mallob. In each directory, you can find the following files and directories:

* `slurm-*.out`: The log file generated by SLURM, the job scheduler employed at the used supercomputer.
* `*/`: Each directory `i` contains all log files created by MPI rank `i`. Due to space limitations, we only provide these directories for rank zero as well as for each rank which we configured to introduce jobs to the system.

Each directory contains the following files:

* `log.<rank>`: The output of the PE's main thread.
* `log.<rank>.janitor`: The output of the background thread responsible for cleaning up old job contexts.
* `log.<rank>.<balancing|treegrowth>-latencies`: Lists of raw floating-point values (in seconds) for individual event latencies.
* `subproc.<rank>`: The output of the PE's worker processes and threads.

In addition, each directory of a PE configured to introduce jobs contains the following files:

* `log.<rank>.i`, `log.<rank>.i-fs`, `log.<rank>.i-api`, `log.<rank>.streamer`: The output of background threads introducing jobs.
* `log.<rank>.reader`: The output of background threads parsing descriptions of introduced jobs.
