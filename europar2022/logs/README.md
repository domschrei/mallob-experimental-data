# logs/

Each directory corresponds to one certain run of Mallob. In each directory, you can find the following files and directories:

* `slurm-*.out`: The log file generated by SLURM, the job scheduler employed at the used supercomputer.
* `*/`: Each directory `i` contains all log files created by MPI rank `i`. Due to space limitations, we only provide these directories for rank zero as well as for each rank which we configured to introduce jobs to the system.

Each directory contains the following files:

* `log.<rank>`: The output of the PE's main thread.
* `log.<rank>.janitor`: The output of the background thread responsible for cleaning up old job contexts.
* `log.<rank>.<balancing|treegrowth>-latencies`: Lists of raw floating-point values (in seconds) for individual event latencies.
* `subproc.<rank>`: The output of the PE's worker processes and threads.

In addition, each directory of a PE configured to introduce jobs contains the following files:

* `log.<rank>.i`, `log.<rank>.i-fs`, `log.<rank>.i-api`, `log.<rank>.streamer`: The output of background threads introducing jobs.
* `log.<rank>.reader`: The output of background threads parsing descriptions of introduced jobs.

## Result Files

We provide some central data extracted from the log files:

* `mallob_priorities`: The file `priorities` contains the nine used priority values. The file `avg_volumes` contains for each job ID its average assigned volume over time. The jobs of highest priority have IDs < 100'000, the jobs of the second highest priority have IDs < 200'000, and so on. For each priority, the same set of 80 jobs has been processed repeatedly (to guarantee constant system utilization even if one of the streams already processed 80 jobs). Each file `response_times.<k>` contains successful response times among the first 80 jobs of k-th highest priority.
