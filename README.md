## Content

* `experiments/`: Contains the gathered experimental data. **Note:** As our system produced many Gigabytes of logging output, we only provide condensed runtime and performance information for each (set of) experiments. Please let us know if you wish to access some full logs or if you are missing some relevant data about an experiment.
* `figures/`: Some figures and plots we produced from the data in `experiments/` which may be useful or interesting (some of which are included in the main paper or in the appendix).
* `instances/`: The raw data and the result of our careful benchmark selection process.
